## Budget Tracker Web App

This project is a buget tracking web app designed to allow you to input your expenses and how much you desire to spend on certain luxuries as a flat rate or percentage of your paycheck, and further subdivide your monthy savings into different investments and savings accounts.

Built with React with the intention of allowing users to log in and save their budgets to come back each pay period to see how much money should be allocated to each expense, investment, and savings account.
